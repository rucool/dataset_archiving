# Updates for AZFP glider dataset attributes used in acoustics_glider_to_archive.py
processing_level: Delayed mode dataset. QA/QC measures have been run according to the IOOS Manual of Glider Data. Suspect/failed IOOS QC values, and values flagged by a CTD hysteresis test have been removed from this dataset (QC and post-processing code can be found at https://github.com/rucool/rugliderqc). pH and dissolved oxygen (when applicable) have been adjusted for sensor lag by applying optimal time shifts calculated by glider segment in order to minimize separation between glider down and upcasts as described in Saba et al 2019 https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00664 and Wright-Fairbanks et al 2020 https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JC016505. AZFP data were processed using Echoview (https://echoview.com/) according to Simmonds and MacLennan 2005 DOI:10.1002/9780470995303 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470995303).
