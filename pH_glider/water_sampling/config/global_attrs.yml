comment: pH, TA, and DIC measurements from discrete water samples taken at glider deployments and recoveries. Water samples were collected at multiple depths via Niskin bottles mounted on a CTD-rosette, or via individual Niskin bottle casts. pH (on the Total pH scale) of water samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 25Â°C with purified meta-cresol purple (mCP, Liu et al. 2011) using 10 cm pathlength cylindrical glass cells and an Agilent Technologies Cary 8454 UV-Vis spectrometer. pH was calculated according to the equations presented in Douglas and Byrne (2017). Total alkalinity (TA) titrations for water samples were performed by a custom-built titration apparatus, following the approach of Standard Operating Procedure 3b (Dickson et al. 2007). These values have not been corrected for temperature, pressure, or salinity.

summary: For each project, underwater Slocum gliders were deployed with an integrated CTD and deep rated version of the Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET)-based pH sensor as well as other sensors. Water samples were taken during deployment and recovery to ground-truth the glider-based pH sensor.
